The Manhattan Taxi Demand Prediction system is implemented as a comprehensive web application using Streamlit, incorporating multiple machine learning models and interactive visualization components. The system architecture consists of several key components:

1. Model Architecture:
Primary Prediction Models:
CNN-LSTM Encoder-Decoder for deep learning predictions
Machine Learning model (Gradient Boosting) for traditional feature-based predictions
Hybrid approach combining both models for improved accuracy

2. Data Processing Pipeline:
Weather data integration (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed)
Temporal feature engineering (hour, day, month, holidays)
Location-based feature processing
Real-time data normalization and scaling

3. Frontend Implementation:
Interactive dashboard with real-time updates
Geospatial visualization using Folium
Dynamic charts and graphs using Plotly and Altair
Responsive design with custom CSS styling.
Zoom feature for heatmaps
